# `@foo-software/ghost-graphql-server`

A GraphQL server for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). This project exports an [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) class with pre-defined options to provide querying of a Ghost blog API programmatically and exposes a CLI for command line usage. Below are features of this project.

- Included types for TypeScript support (this project is written in TypeScript as a matter of fact).
- Exports an Apollo Server class as a module supporting overriding options (to override the pre-populated options that resolve Ghost API endpoints).
- Exposes a CLI (with limited options).

_If you're looking to import resolvers or other pieces independently - head over to the [`@foo-software/ghost-graphql` package](https://github.com/foo-software/ghost-graphql/tree/master/packages/ghost-graphql)._

## Ghost Content API

See the [`@foo-software/ghost-graphql` package](https://github.com/foo-software/ghost-graphql/tree/master/packages/ghost-graphql#ghost-content-api).

#### Pagination and Filtering

## Programmatic Usage

It's important to note that [some enviroment variables](#environment-variables) are required.

```javascript
import { createGhostGraphQLServer } from '@foo-software/ghost-graphql-server';

const startServer = async () => {
  try {
    const server = createGhostGraphQLServer();
    await server.listen(port);
    console.log(`Ghost GraphQL server is running on port ${port} ðŸš€`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

startServer();
```

Or with options. You can use any [options available to `Apollo Server`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server/#options).

```javascript
const server = createGhostGraphQLServer({
  onHealthCheck: () => {
    return Promise.resolve();
  },
});
```

#### `createGhostGraphQLServer` Options

You can use any [options available to `Apollo Server`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server/#options).

## CLI Usage

```bash
npm install @foo-software/ghost-graphql-server -g
```

Run the server with required environment variables.

```bash
